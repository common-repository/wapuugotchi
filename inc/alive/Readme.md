# Alive

The "Alive" feature breathes life into your WapuuGotchi avatar by adding dynamic animations that create the illusion of an autonomous, living character. This feature removes all predefined animations from the avatar's SVG file and introduces a system that randomly selects and applies animations at runtime. Each animation plays to completion before being removed, and after a random interval, a new animation is applied. This process continues indefinitely, giving the avatar a lively and unpredictable behavior.

## Features

- ***Random Animation Selection:*** At runtime, a random animation is selected from a predefined list and added to the avatar's SVG.
- ***Animation Removal:*** Once an animation has finished playing, it is automatically removed from the SVG.
- ***Endless Loop:*** This process repeats indefinitely, ensuring that the avatar constantly exhibits new and varied animations.
